HW 2 README



	I was unable to finish the program. Not because of difficulty, but time. I'd rather submit what I was able to do rather than try and finish and take the late
	penalty. I was able to get about 2/3 of the program done. 

	I was able to create a deck file that creates a deck of cards that shuffles them and allows players to draw from it.

	I was also able to create each player, which I believe was the core of the program.

	I was also able to get Stud coded as this was the easier of the two games. 

	The part of my program that is missing is Draw One Pre-school Poker.

	As it does not say anywhere in the syllabus that we cannot submit partially complete code, I am hoping I can get a decent amount of credit for this.
	I figured I should include this information here rather than have you waste your time searching for my other files.

	Though I completed the hardest part of the code, I have unfortunately ran out of time and need to begin my submission process.
	I'll be sure to cut back on my hours at work as I'm employed at a super-market they have been maxing out my availability to ensure 
	this does not happen again.
